# PHP-Password
### This is a basic tool to password protect content using PHP.

* To change the password, change the number `1234` on lines `2` and `14` in file.php.
* To change the protected content, change `<h1>SECRECT STUFF HERE</h1>` on line `15` in file.php.
* Make sure to change the URL on line `3` in file.php to `https://yourwebsite.com/file` and add `?status=wrong` to the end of it.
